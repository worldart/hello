CIR Model

The CIR model is a mathematical model used to describe the evolution of interest rates over time. It is a type of stochastic process commonly used in financial mathematics to model the dynamics of short-term interest rates. It is developed by John Cox, Jonathan Ingersoll, and Stephen Ross in 1985, the model belongs to the broader class of one-factor models that aim to capture the behavior of the short-term interest rate, which is crucial for pricing bonds and interest rate derivatives like options.â€¨Some Features of the CIR Model
* Mean Reversion
* Non-negativity
* Volatility Term: The volatility depends on the square root of the current interest rate, meaning that volatility decreases as the interest rate approaches zero and increases when interest rates are high.
The CIR model is highly applicable is
* Bond Pricing
* Interest Rate Derivatives
* Risk Management
